# Socialium / React Social Media App 

Socialium is a project created using reactjs, nodejs, express, mongodb (MERN Stack) üë®‚Äçüíª <br> 
By making a real social media application, I experienced the building phase from start to finish, what tools were used, what difficulties were encountered, and how they should be solved. <br>
üõ† Currently, there is a little problem with retrieving data only in MongoDB. If I fix it, it will make much more sense.
